    <h1>Bursaries</h1>
    <p>
        The Fourth International Workshop of Social Learning and Cultural Evolution is this year partnered with the Cultural Evolution Society - this partnership enables us to offer a number of bursaries to postgraduate students and early career researchers to attend the workshop. In order to facilitate the goals of both workshop organisers and the Cultural Evolution Society, these bursaries are aimed primarily at researchers who are not currently involved in the Artificial Life community, or those who have never managed to attend an Artificial Life conference. We are particularly keen to offer bursaries to members of the Cultural Evolution Society (CES) and members of the ESLR society.    
    </p>
    <p>
        Bursaries, up to £150, will be offered to cover the cost of registration to attend the <a href="https://2019.alife.org/">Artificial Life 2019</a> conference on Tuesday 30th June, and in the case of postgraduate students also some travel costs. As successful applicants will be registered for the Tuesday session of the Artificial Life 2019 conference, they will also be welcome to attend the 2 conference keynote addresses arranged between the workshop session, and will have lunch and tea/coffee provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        To apply for funding please submit an extended abstract (max 1 page) on either some of your recent work in Social Learning and Cultural Evolution, or on the subject of "Grand Challenges and Key Questions in Social Learning and Cultural Evolution". Please also include a paragraph explaining why you would like to attend the workshop/ why you would like engage with the Artificial Life community, and also a breakdown of costs (up to £150). All successful applicants will be expected to bring along a poster to present over lunch at our interdisciplinary poster and meet and greet session. 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Submissions will be accepted at EasyChair until July 16th and authors will be notified by no later than July 19th.
        <li>Submission Link <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=slace2019">Easy Chair</a></li>
        <li>Contact e-mail: <a href="mailto:slace2019@easychair.org" target="_top">slace2019@easychair.org</a><a href="mailto:j.borg@keele.ac.uk" target="_top">j.borg@keele.ac.uk</a><a href="mailto:cmarriot@uw.edu" target="_top">cmarriot@uw.edu</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Bursaries will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis, on all appropriate applications. We will not consider applications by established researchers, researchers already attending the Artificial Life 2019 conference, or from researchers who are not interested engaging in the workshop.
