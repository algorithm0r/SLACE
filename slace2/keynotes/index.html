    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
        The functioning of human societies fundamentally relies on social
        forces, in particular cooperation in the exchange of resources and the
        solution of collective action problems. Scholars mostly agree
        evolutionary processes have selected for cooperation in our ancestral
        small-scale hunter-gatherer societies. However, there is still much
        controversy about which behavioural mechanisms maintain cooperation in
        large-scale societies. Are the same mechanisms at work, or is some new
        mechanism needed? Confusion over this has frustrated our understanding
        of one of the most pressing questions in both evolutionary biology and
        the social sciences -- how could large-scale societies ever have
        arisen? To address this, we first examine how, if at all, cooperation
        in large-scale societies is actually different to cooperation in
        small-scale societies. We then examine the possible behavioural
        mechanisms that could produce this cooperation. We stress that the
        behavioural mechanisms themselves could not plausibly have changed
        between small- and large-scale societies. Finally, we use the
        framework of behavioural mechanisms to review the most common
        hypothesis that has been proposed for the origin of large-scale
        societies: cultural group selection. We show that this relies on
        behavioural mechanisms that are incompatible with most of evolutionary
        biology and the social sciences. As a result, we introduce an
        alternative explanation for large-scale societies -- the institutional
        path hypothesis. Crucially, this relies only on behavioural mechanisms
        that are are compatible with evolutionary theory, behavioural ecology,
        economics and political science. We therefore suggest that this
        represents a more parsimonious alternative for why large-scale
        societies work.

        My current research interests involve modelling social interactions using analytical and agent-based models. I approach this both from the perspective of economics, and by using evolutionary algorithms to model the spread of culturally-transmitted behaviours (social learning) in populations. I am particularly interested in the processes by which social institutions in human groups evolve over time, and on the conditions under which institutions can promote cooperation in large-scale groups of self-interested agents.

        I also maintain interests in applying artificial immune systems to intrusion detection, and in neural networks for both machine learning and as models of behaviour.

        I previously held postdoctoral positions with Prof. Laurent Lehmann at the Department of Ecology & Evolution, University of Lausanne, and with Dr. Joanna Bryson at the Department of Computer Science, University of Bath. My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Social niche construction: Evolutionary explanations for cooperative group formation", and was supervised by Prof. Richard Watson at the School of Electronics & Computer Science, University of Southampton.
