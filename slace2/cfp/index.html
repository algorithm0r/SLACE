        <p>
            In social species, learning from others, i.e. social learning, is one of the
            cornerstones of cognitive development. Social learning has been shown
            to increase the learning speed of individuals, but also enables them to reach
            a higher performance in comparison with learning individually.
            Social learning also enables local populations to develop a culture that can evolve
            over time. Realising social learning in artificial systems faces many challenges
            requiring inputs from machine learning, robotics and evolutionary biology.
        </p>

        <p>
            The aim of this workshop is to promote discussions on social learning and
            cultural evolution with a special emphasis on the future of of the field.
            Social learning has been actively studied in psychology but is still in its infancy
            in artificial systems. Many open questions remain, such as when is social learning
            advantageous, or what kind of information should be transferred. These questions
            have been studied but a consensus has yet to be reached, mainly because of
            the difficulty to compare results in social learning due to the absence of a
            common research framework. This workshop is devoted to discuss and establish
            such a framework that will push the research forward.
        </p>

        <p>
            The core of the workshop will consist of short presentations
            from contributors on their work in the field (current or historical),
            collective research goals and milestones in social learning and
            cultural evolution or new concepts, modelling techniques or research
            questions. Presenters are encouraged to address any of the following
            topics (though this list is not exhaustive):

        <p>
            We ask potential contributors to submit an extended abstract (1 page).
            We are open to presenters who are contributing during
            the main ECAL conference to also talk about their work during the
            workshop in order to have additional discussions. PhD students and
            young career academics who are new to the field are encouraged to
            submit to this workshop.
